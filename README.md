# HDRPlus
A Large Scale Dataset for Source Camera Identification of High Dynamic Range Image
A official public dataset for paper "HDRPlus: A Large Scale Dataset for Source Camera Identification of High Dynamic Range Image" 
## Background
Source camera identification aims to establish the correlation between images and source devices, which is an important branch of research in the field of multimedia forensics. Source camera identification based on sensor pattern noise is currently recognized as the most reliable technology scheme, which assumes that the pixel position between the device fingerprint and the image is synchronized. In recent years, the rapid development of computational imaging technology has subverted the smartphone imaging method and changed the digital image acquisition process. Among the most significant of these developments is high dynamic range (HDR) imaging. HDR photography, widely available in modern smartphones, achieves a broader range of luminance by combining multiple images with varying exposure levels. As a result, this process causes the device fingerprint to lose its spatial alignment with the image content, presenting a novel challenge to the field of source camera identification. Consequently, research in HDR image forensics has become an urgent necessity. Despite the growing demand for studies in this area, existing datasets for HDR image source camera identification are relatively small in scale, which could introduce potential biases in the data and limits the generalizability of findings. Based on this, this paper present a large-scale dataset for HDR image forensics, named HDRPlus. This dataset consists of 14578 images captured by 28 modern smartphones from four major brands. The devices used compose of 10 single-camera smartphones and 18 multi-camera smartphones. For each device, between 165 and 598 images were taken in both default and HDR modes, covering a variety of indoor and outdoor scenes. The newly created HDRPlus dataset is then used to evaluate the effectiveness of existing source camera identification methods based on sensor pattern noise. Experimental results reveal that the performance of these forensics methods degrades significantly when applied to images captured by multi-camera devices or in HDR mode. Moreover, the results indicate considerable variation in performance across devices from different manufacturers and for images with diverse content. This highlights the complexity of the problem and underscores the need for further research and development in this area. Ultimately, the HDRPlus dataset will provide good data support for future work in the field of digital image source camera identification, especially in addressing the challenges posed by HDR imaging and the increasing prevalence of multi-camera smartphones.

## Conclusions

In response to the current lack of a large-scale high dynamic range image database, this article constructs a database called HDRPlus, which contains a large number of high dynamic range images, with each device capturing 165 to 598 HDR images. The image content is rich, covering various indoor and outdoor scenes, making it a high-quality image database suitable for source camera identification.
